Verified Braun Heaps
====================

A (eventually) fully verified priority queue using Braun heaps in Agda

Braun heaps (or Brown heaps, as CS19 students at Brown will know them) are a form of binary trees where at every node, the left subtree is the same size or one greater than the right subtree.

Currently I'm using all my own library code, but eventually I plan to use the actual Agda standard library. (First language I've used that requires you to install the standard library separetly...)
